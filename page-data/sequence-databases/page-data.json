The header includes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accession: an unique sequence id</li>\n<li>Version: accession nr + version</li>\n<li>Source: Species</li>\n<li>Organism: whole taxification</li>\n<li>Reference</li>\n<li>Authors, title, journal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the header comes the features-section of the GeneBank Flat File. The features section has two columns, one with keys like <em>source</em> and <em>CDS</em> (coding sequence) and one with the annotations to the sequence (i.e. the translated sequence in polypeptides).</p>\n<p>The last part of the file consists of the origin-section. It contains actual nucleotide sequence.</p>\n<h2>Sequence similariy search</h2>\n<p>Similariy is a quanitity (15% or 30%) and homology is a boolean/inference.</p>\n<p>When searching for distant relationships, it's good to seach protein sequence databases. Then it's possible to identify sequences that share ancestors >= 1 billion years ago (longest is over 2.5 billion years). For non-coding DNA sequences, it's hard to go back in time more than 200 million years. Protein coding sequences can go back 600 million years.</p>\n<h3>Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)</h3>\n<p>The most popular programs f√∂r finding homologous sequences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BLASTP: amino acid search in protein DB.</li>\n<li>BLASTN: nucleotide search in nucleotide DB.</li>\n<li>BLASTX: protein sequence generated from translation of nucleotide (in all 6 frames) in a protein DB.</li>\n<li>TBLASTN: protein sequence in a DB with other nucleotide sequences translated in all 6 frames.</li>\n<li>TBLASTX: same input as BLASTX but in a DB with other nucleotide sequences also translated in all 6 frames.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The search result includes an E-value which tells the probability of find this match by pure chance.</p>\n<p>Factors to think about when finding a match:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall alignment</li>\n<li>Gene duplications</li>\n<li>Distance between species</li>\n<li>Degree of protein conservation</li>\n<li>Is it part of a metabolic pathway?</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 14, 2020","path":"/sequence-databases","title":"Info about sequence databases","thumbnail":"assets/picture-3.jpg","metaDescription":"sequence databases"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
